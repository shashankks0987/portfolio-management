### Notebook compares 5 assests across categories using 2 different portfolio optimization techniques

The main difference between risk parity optimization and mean-variance optimization lies in the approach they take to portfolio construction and risk management:

Objective: Mean-variance optimization aims to maximize the expected return of a portfolio while minimizing its variance (or risk). It seeks to find the allocation that offers the best tradeoff between risk and return. Risk parity optimization, on the other hand, aims to balance the risk contribution of each asset in the portfolio, without necessarily maximizing returns.

Risk Measure: Mean-variance optimization focuses on variance (or standard deviation) as the primary measure of risk. It assumes that risk is solely defined by the asset's volatility. In contrast, risk parity optimization considers the contribution of each asset to the total portfolio risk, aiming to equalize the risk contribution across assets.

Asset Weights: In mean-variance optimization, asset weights are determined based on a combination of expected returns, variances, and covariances of the assets. The optimization process aims to find the weights that maximize return for a given level of risk or minimize risk for a given level of return. In risk parity optimization, asset weights are determined based on their risk contributions. Assets with higher risk contributions receive lower weights, while assets with lower risk contributions receive higher weights, aiming for an equal risk contribution from each asset.

Diversification: Both methods emphasize diversification, but they approach it differently. Mean-variance optimization seeks to achieve diversification by considering the covariance structure between assets, attempting to combine assets with low or negative correlations. Risk parity optimization, on the other hand, diversifies by equalizing the risk contribution across assets, irrespective of their correlations.

Risk-Return Tradeoff: Mean-variance optimization explicitly considers the tradeoff between risk and return, allowing investors to choose an optimal point on the efficient frontier. Risk parity optimization, however, does not prioritize maximizing returns but rather seeks to achieve a balanced risk contribution.

In summary, mean-variance optimization focuses on finding the allocation that provides the best tradeoff between risk and return, considering asset expected returns, variances, and covariances. Risk parity optimization aims to balance the risk contribution of each asset in the portfolio, seeking equal risk allocation across assets without explicitly targeting maximum returns.
